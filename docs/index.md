The QuantEcon Indian Summer Workshop is an online intensive course in
quantitative economics for Indian students, presented by
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) and designed in conjunction with the
[Department of Economics at Ashoka
University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/department/department-of-economics/) the
[Delhi School of Economics](http://econdse.org/) and the [Indian Statistical
Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/).  The target audience for the course is
talented young economists in India who want to learn about  data science and
computer-driven economic modeling.  The course will provide students with an
introduction and exposure to key tools in quantitative economics that are
increasingly in demand in graduate programs in economics and the private
sector

The lead instructor and academic coordinator for the program is [Thomas J.
Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/), co-founder of QuantEcon, Professor of
Economics at New York University, and 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economic
Sciences.

## Dates

* Week one: August 8th--12th (Monday--Friday) 
* Week two: August 15th--19th (Monday--Friday) 

## Syllabus

The language of instruction will be English.  The programming language used in
the course will be Python.

The course will be run online as a series of 10 three-hour classes.  The
course will cover selected topics from 

* Foundations of programming in Python
* Data engineering with Pandas
* Linear algebra, principal components and matrix decompositions
* Optimization, filtering, dynamic programming and optimal control
* Search and matching models
* Asset pricing
* Bayesian and frequentist statistics
* Economic and social networks
* Linear programming, optimal transport and mechanism design
* Introduction to auction theory
* Quantitative economic history
* High-performance computing with Python

Background reading on these topics can be found in the following lecture
series:

* [Python Programming for Economics and Finance](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html)
* [Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html)


## Mode of Instruction

Students will require access to a computer.  (Programming tasks will be
assigned but there is no need to install software. There are good free online
platforms that provide the Python environments that we'll be using.) Students
will be provided with materials to help them prepare for classes and solidify
understandings of earlier classes.  

Students will be encouraged to form study groups to foster working in teams (a
valuable skill in both industry and government and academia) We hope that
study groups can include students with mixtures of skills and mathematical and
statistics backgrounds. (This also typically happens in industry and
government and academia.)


## Learning Outcomes

Participants will learn how to connect economic modeling problems to numerical
implementations in Python using clear, efficient and effective code.
Participants will be able to apply basic software engineering principles to
organize, share and collaborate on coding problems.

These skills are in high demand for economists and data scientists at leading
tech companies and universities around the world.

## Eligibility

The course material will be challenging.  Ideal candidates will already have
had at least some exposure to probability, linear algebra and principles of economics,
up to the level of a good undergraduate economics or computer science
program.  Programming experience will be helpful but is not a prerequisite.
