# QuantEcon Summer Course in Quantitative Economics

The QuantEcon Indian Summer Workshop is an online intensive course in
quantitative economics for Indian students, presented by
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) and designed in conjunction with the
[Department of Economics at Ashoka
University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/department/department-of-economics/) the
[Delhi School of Economics](http://econdse.org/) and the [Indian Statistical
Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/).  The target audience for the course is
talented young economists in India who want to learn about  data science and
computer-driven economic modeling.  The course will provide students with an
introduction and exposure to key tools in quantitative economics that are
increasingly in demand in graduate programs in economics and the private
sector

The lead instructor and academic coordinator for the program is [Thomas J.
Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/), co-founder of QuantEcon, Professor of
Economics at New York University, and 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economic
